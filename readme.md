This is the CS331 Assignments page for Lucas Dunn and Garrett Biwer

It contains the code for every project we complete in the CS 331 class.

The first project, entitled "8_puzzle" has code utilizing A* search to compare and contrast various heuristics. These include total city-block distance (AKA manhattan distance), number of misplaced tiles, and a heuristic which checks if the "1" "2" and "3" tiles are misplaced.
